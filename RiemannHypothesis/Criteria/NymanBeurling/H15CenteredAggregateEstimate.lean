# Corrected H15 centered aggregate interface

The earlier Farey-cell correlation interfaces quantified over independent
weights (including point masses) and demanded a logarithmic saving for every
individual cell.  Such an estimate cannot be the H15 input: the actual
kernel produces one coupled, `N`-dependent aggregate, and its main terms must
remain paired before cancellation is estimated.

This module freezes that exact aggregate in the normalization already used by
the quadratic-interaction finish.  It is deliberately a single analytic
number-theory target.  In particular, it does not claim that a generic
averaged-Chowla, logarithmically averaged, or DFI statement implies the
bound; theorem matching is a prerequisite for any such bridge.

/-- The signed, centered H15 expression after the finite Farey and Fourier
bookkeeping has been aggregated with the specific cutoff-Möbius weights.  The
log-ratio, Bernoulli, and linear terms are intentionally kept in one absolute

The sole content-bearing H15 input in the corrected final route.

It is an aggregate estimate for the specific cutoff-Möbius kernel, uniformly
in its cutoff `N`; it has no quantification over arbitrary weights, Farey
cells, or affine forms.  A future analytic proof may derive it through a
Vaaler reciprocal-phase reduction, but that derivation is not asserted here.
