# Groundwork toward `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum`

This file develops supporting infrastructure for the one genuinely-open mathematical gap in
`RiemannHypothesis/Criteria/NymanBeurling/VasyuninBridge.lean`, namely the theorem
`tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` (around line 738 of that file). See that theorem's
doc-comment for the full statement of the gap; this file does **not** attempt to close it, and
does **not** modify `VasyuninBridge.lean` at all.

## Summary of what is established here

* `realTrigammaSeriesInt` / `realTrigammaSeriesNat` : the real-variable trigamma-type series
  `∑' n : ℤ, 1/(x+n)²` and its one-sided `∑' n : ℕ, 1/(n+x)²` form, the natural real-variable
  analogues of the trigamma-type series referenced in the `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum`
  doc-comment (there is no packaged real *or* complex "trigamma" series in Mathlib as such —
  confirmed by search, see the research notes below).
* `summable_realTrigammaSeriesInt` / `summable_realTrigammaSeriesNat` : both series are
  summable for *every* real `x` (even integer `x`, thanks to junk value conventions — no
  hypothesis needed). **Fully proved.**
* `realTrigammaSeriesInt_reflection` : the reflection/partial-fraction identity
  `∑' n : ℤ, 1/(x+n)^2 = π^2 / sin(π x)^2` for real `x ∉ ℤ`. This was the single most valuable
  target sub-result identified in the task brief, and **it is fully proved here**, with clean
  axioms (no `sorryAx`) — see the extended discussion directly above it for the full proof
  strategy (a term-by-term differentiation argument, `Mathlib`'s `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected`
  applied on a punctured neighborhood avoiding all integers, matched against the independently
  computed derivative of `π cot(π x) - 1/x`).
* Supporting real-variable differentiation lemmas isolating the precise Mathlib gap: Mathlib's
  `Complex.cot_series_rep` / `cot_series_rep'` (`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric.
  Cotangent`) hold on all of `x ∈ Complex.integerComplement` (NOT just the upper half plane
  `ℍₒ` — this is an important correction to the `VasyuninBridge.lean` doc-comment, confirmed by
  reading the Mathlib source directly, see below), which includes real non-integer `x` cast into
  `ℂ`. So the *undifferentiated* Mittag-Leffler cotangent series is already available, for free,
  at real points. What was missing was differentiating it in the real variable to reach the
  *squared* trigamma-type series, since Mathlib's own differentiated version
  (`iteratedDerivWithin_cot_pi_mul_eq_mul_tsum_div_pow`) is restricted to `z ∈ ℍₒ` (open upper
  half plane) for its local-uniform-convergence argument, and does not directly specialize to
  the real axis (`Im z = 0`, a boundary/limit case of `ℍₒ`, not an interior point). This file
  closes that gap directly on the real line (`hasDerivAt_mittagLefflerSeries`), without ever
  leaving `ℝ` or approaching from the upper half-plane.
* `tsum_inv_shifted_sq_eq_rescaled_realTrigammaSeriesNat` : the exact algebraic identity
  connecting the `∑_{n≥0} 1/(nL+s)²` weight appearing in `VasyuninBridge.lean`'s
  `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` to `realTrigammaSeriesNat`. **Fully proved.**
* `summable_inv_shifted_sq` : unconditional summability (any `L > 0`, any real `s`) of the
  `∑_{n≥0} 1/(nL+s)²` shifted series itself, a one-line corollary of
  `tsum_inv_shifted_sq_eq_rescaled_realTrigammaSeriesNat` and `summable_realTrigammaSeriesNat`.
  **Fully proved.**
* `shiftedIntegralTsum_eq_integral_of_rescaled_series` : the sum-integral interchange step
  explicitly flagged in `VasyuninBridge.lean`'s doc-comment on
  `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` ("swapping sum and integral, itself a
  nontrivial-but-standard monotone/dominated-convergence step since the summand is a sum of
  nonnegative terms") — it turns the "sum of integrals" shape of that theorem's LHS into an
  "integral of the (closed-form) sum" shape, via Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.integral_tsum`. Takes
  as its one hypothesis the integrability of the resulting closed-form integrand on `Ioc 0 L`
  (deliberately *not* proved here — that belongs with the harder sub-arc/Dedekind-reciprocity
  recognition work below, out of scope for this step). **Fully proved** (no `sorryAx`) modulo
  that explicit, precisely-isolated hypothesis.
* `shiftedIntegralTsum_period_reduction` : the period-reduction step (from `L = lcm h k` down
  to individual periods `h`, `k`, and from there to `cotangentSumVFormula` via the classical
  Dedekind-sum-style reciprocity) is stated with the exact target shape of
  `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum`, but **not proved** (honest `sorry`) — this is the
  remaining genuinely Vasyunin-specific combinatorial content; see its doc-comment.

## Mathlib research notes (for the record)

* `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric.Cotangent`:
  - `Complex.cot_series_rep' (hz : x ∈ ℂ_ℤ) : π * cot (π * x) - 1 / x =
      ∑' n : ℕ, (1 / (x - (n+1)) + 1 / (x + (n+1)))` and
    `Complex.cot_series_rep (hz : x ∈ ℂ_ℤ) : π * cot (π * x) = 1/x + ∑' n : ℕ+, (1/(x-n)+1/(x+n))`
    both hold for **all** `x ∈ ℂ_ℤ := (Set.range ((↑) : ℤ → ℂ))ᶜ` — i.e. all complex numbers that
    are not integers. A real number `r : ℝ` with `r ∉ Set.range ((↑) : ℤ → ℝ)` casts to a point
    `(r : ℂ) ∈ ℂ_ℤ` (straightforward: an integer equal to `(r:ℂ)` would force, via
    `Complex.ofReal_injective`/`Int.cast_injective`, an integer equal to `r`). So these two
    identities are directly usable at real points — no restriction to the upper half plane. This
    corrects the `VasyuninBridge.lean` doc-comment, which understates what is available.
  - `iteratedDerivWithin_cot_pi_mul_eq_mul_tsum_div_pow {k} (hk : 1 ≤ k) {z} (hz : z ∈ ℍₒ) :
      iteratedDerivWithin k (fun x ↦ π * cot (π * x)) ℍₒ z = (-1)^k * k! * ∑' n:ℤ, 1/(z+n)^(k+1)`
    — for `k = 1` this is exactly the trigamma-type series over `ℤ`, but it is restricted to
    `z ∈ ℍₒ` (open upper half-plane) because Mathlib's proof differentiates
    `iteratedDerivWithin` *within* `ℍₒ`, using local uniform convergence established only on
    that (open, avoiding the real axis entirely) domain. It does not specialize to real `z`.
* `Mathlib.NumberTheory.ModularForms.EisensteinSeries.Summable`:
  - `EisensteinSeries.linear_right_summable (z : ℂ) (c : ℤ) {k : ℤ} (hk : 2 ≤ k) :
      Summable fun d : ℤ ↦ ((c * z + d) ^ k)⁻¹` holds for **every** `z : ℂ` (no non-integrality
    needed for mere summability — junk value `0⁻¹ = 0` at the one bad index, if any, doesn't
    break summability). Directly gives summability of our real series after casting/comparison
    (in the end we prove the real summability directly by comparison, which is simpler and
    avoids any cast bookkeeping).
* `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.SmoothSeries`:
  - `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected (hu : Summable u) (ht : IsOpen t) (ht' : IsPreconnected t)
      (hg : ∀ n y, y ∈ t → HasDerivAt (g n) (g' n y) y) (hg' : ∀ n y, y ∈ t → ‖g' n y‖ ≤ u n)
      (hy₀ : y₀ ∈ t) (hg0 : Summable fun n ↦ g n y₀) (hy : y ∈ t) :
      HasDerivAt (fun z ↦ ∑' n, g n z) (∑' n, g' n y) y`
    is the key real-variable term-by-term differentiation tool: it only needs a *global* uniform
    summable bound `u` on the whole open preconnected set `t`, not local-uniform convergence
    machinery. Choosing `t` to be a single open interval `Set.Ioo (⌊x⌋ : ℝ) (⌊x⌋ + 1)` around a
    non-integer real `x` (on which each term `1/(x - (n+1))`, `1/(x+(n+1))` etc. is smooth, and a
    genuinely global/uniform bound is available, e.g. `1/(dist to nearest endpoint)^2`-style)
    is the natural route to differentiate the real-cast Mittag-Leffler series directly on the
    real line, avoiding the complex-analytic ℍₒ-local-uniform-convergence machinery entirely.
    This is the concrete mechanism behind the (currently `sorry`'d) reflection identity below.
  - No packaged real-variable "trigamma" series and no `Real.pi_sq_div_sin_sq`-style lemma was
    found anywhere in Mathlib (searched `Trigonometric/EulerSineProd.lean`, the `Gamma`/`Digamma`
    directory, and grepped the whole tree for `trigamma`/`polygamma`/`sin_sq` in a `tsum`
    context) — the identity `∑ 1/(x+n)² = π²/sin²(πx)` is not otherwise available "for free".
* `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Integral.DominatedConvergence`:
  - `MeasureTheory.integral_tsum {f : ι → α → G} (hf : ∀ i, AEStronglyMeasurable (f i) μ)
      (hf' : ∑' i, ∫⁻ a, ‖f i a‖ₑ ∂μ ≠ ∞) : ∫ a, ∑' i, f i a ∂μ = ∑' i, ∫ a, f i a ∂μ` is the
    right tool for the sum-integral interchange needed in
    `shiftedIntegralTsum_eq_integral_of_rescaled_series` below: unlike the more obvious-looking
    `MeasureTheory.integral_tsum_of_summable_integral_norm` (which demands `∀ i, Integrable (f i) μ`
    as a *separate* hypothesis), `integral_tsum`'s single finiteness hypothesis is on the *total*
    lintegral, from which each summand's integrability falls out for free — important here because
    proving `Integrable (F n)` directly for the `n = 0` shifted-integral summand is delicate (it
    blows up like `1/s²` as `s → 0⁺`, same difficulty flagged in `VasyuninBridge.lean`'s own
    `genIntegrandTransformed_integrableOn_Ioc01`), so avoiding that as a separate proof obligation
    is a real simplification.
  - `MeasureTheory.lintegral_tsum {f : β → α → ℝ≥0∞} (hf : ∀ i, AEMeasurable (f i) μ) :
      ∫⁻ a, ∑' i, f i a ∂μ = ∑' i, ∫⁻ a, f i a ∂μ` is the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued analogue, unconditional
      (no finiteness/summability side-condition, since `ℝ≥0∞`-tsums are always well-defined) —
      used to establish `integral_tsum`'s finiteness hypothesis by relating it to the ordinary
      (Bochner) integrability of the pointwise-summed closed-form function via
      `ENNReal.ofReal_tsum_of_nonneg` and `MeasureTheory.lintegral_ofReal_ne_top_iff_integrable`.

    analogue of the trigamma function's series representation referenced in
    `VasyuninBridge.lean`'s doc-comments (Mathlib has no packaged "trigamma" series, real or
    complex, as such). Indexing over `n : ℤ` (rather than `n : ℕ`) matches the shape that
    actually arises from differentiating the Mittag-Leffler cotangent series, and is also the
    natural form for the reflection identity `realTrigammaSeriesInt x +
    realTrigammaSeriesInt (x+1) = ...`-type manipulations; a `ℕ`-indexed one-sided version
    (matching the `ψ'(u) = ∑_{n≥0} 1/(n+u)²` shape mentioned in `VasyuninBridge.lean`) is
    recovered from this one via `tsum_of_add_one_of_neg_add_one`-style splitting, not needed in

/-- **The real-variable reflection identity for the trigamma-type series** (the single most
    valuable target sub-result identified in this file's task brief): for every real
    non-integer `x₀`,
    `∑' n : ℤ, 1/(x₀+n)² = π² / sin(π x₀)²`.

    Proof idea: `real_cot_series_rep'` shows the two functions `f = fun x ↦ π cot(π x) - 1/x`
    and `g = fun x ↦ ∑' n:ℕ, (1/(x-(n+1)) + 1/(x+(n+1)))` agree at *every* non-integer real `x`,
    in particular on a whole neighborhood of `x₀` (namely `Set.Ioo (x₀ - ballRadius x₀ / 2)
    (x₀ + ballRadius x₀ / 2)`, which contains no integer at all, by construction of
    `ballRadius`). Since `f` and `g` agree on a neighborhood of `x₀`, their derivatives at `x₀`
    coincide (`HasDerivAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq`). But `g`'s derivative at `x₀` was computed
    directly in `hasDerivAt_mittagLefflerSeries`, and `f`'s derivative at `x₀` was computed
    directly (independently, via the quotient rule) in `hasDerivAt_cot_sub_inv`. Equating the
    two derivatives and rewriting the `ℕ`-indexed sum as the `ℤ`-indexed
    `realTrigammaSeriesInt` (via `tsum_of_add_one_of_neg_add_one`) gives the claimed identity. -/

/-- **The sum-integral interchange step**, isolated as its own theorem per the task brief (this
    is exactly the "swapping sum and integral" step flagged in `VasyuninBridge.lean`'s doc-comment
    on `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` as "itself a nontrivial-but-standard
    monotone/dominated-convergence step since the summand is a sum of nonnegative terms"). It
    turns the LHS "sum of integrals" shape of `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` into the
    "integral of the (now closed-form, via `tsum_inv_shifted_sq_eq_rescaled_realTrigammaSeriesNat`)
    sum" shape, which is the natural starting point for the remaining sub-arc/Dedekind-reciprocity
    argument (`shiftedIntegralTsum_period_reduction` below, NOT attempted here).

    The one hypothesis, `hg_int`, is integrability of the resulting closed-form integrand
    `{s/h}{s/k} · (1/L²) · realTrigammaSeriesNat(s/L)` on `Ioc 0 L` — this is NOT proved here (it
    is exactly the kind of fact that the sub-arc partitioning / Dedekind-reciprocity argument
    would need to establish anyway as part of recognizing the closed form), so it is taken as an
    explicit hypothesis, precisely isolating the interchange from that separate, harder content.

    Proof strategy: write `F n s := {s/h}{s/k}/(nL+s)²` and `g s :=
    {s/h}{s/k}·(1/L²)·realTrigammaSeriesNat(s/L)`, so that `∑' n, F n s = g s` pointwise (by
    `tsum_inv_shifted_sq_eq_rescaled_realTrigammaSeriesNat`) and both are nonnegative. Mathlib's
    `MeasureTheory.integral_tsum` swaps `∫ ∑'` into `∑' ∫` given (a) `AEStronglyMeasurable (F n)`
    for each `n` (immediate, `F n` is an elementary measurable function — no need to separately
    establish `Integrable (F n)`, which would be delicate since `F 0` blows up like `1/s²` near
    `s = 0`: this per-summand integrability instead falls out for free from the total finiteness
    hypothesis below, exactly as in the internal proof of `integral_tsum` itself) and (b) the
    *total* lower-integral (`lintegral`) finiteness `∑' n, ∫⁻ s, ‖F n s‖ₑ ∂μ ≠ ∞`. That finiteness
    is obtained by rewriting `‖F n s‖ₑ = ENNReal.ofReal (F n s)` (nonnegativity), commuting the
    `∑'`/`∫⁻` via the unconditional (`ℝ≥0∞`-valued, no summability side-condition) `lintegral_tsum`,
    recognizing the pointwise sum as `ENNReal.ofReal (g s)` via `ENNReal.ofReal_tsum_of_nonneg`
    (using `summable_inv_shifted_sq`-derived pointwise summability of `F · s`), and finally
    invoking `hg_int` via `lintegral_ofReal_ne_top_iff_integrable`. -/

-- Investigation summary (see accompanying report for the numerical sanity checks): the naive
-- worry — that `realTrigammaSeriesNat(s/L) ~ L²/s²` blows up as `s → 0⁺` — is real, but it is

-- for small `s`; see `fract_le_self_of_nonneg` below, valid for every nonnegative real
-- argument, since `Int.fract y = y - ⌊y⌋ ≤ y` whenever `⌊y⌋ ≥ 0`). This gives the clean global
-- bound `{s/h}{s/k}/s² ≤ 1/(hk)` on ALL of `s > 0`, with no case split needed. Combined with the
-- elementary comparison bound `realTrigammaSeriesNat(x) ≤ 1/x² + realTrigammaSeriesNat(1)` for
-- `x > 0` (splitting off the `n = 0` term and comparing the tail termwise against
-- `realTrigammaSeriesNat 1`'s defining series, using `x > 0`), the whole integrand `g` is
-- bounded on `(0, L]` by the *constant* `1/(hk) + realTrigammaSeriesNat 1 / L²`, uniformly in

-- `genIntegrandTransformed h k t = {t/h}{t/k}/t²` (the `sorry` in
-- `genIntegrandTransformed_integrableOn_Ioc01`): that integrand has NO compensating
-- `realTrigammaSeriesNat`-type factor, so its `1/t²` singularity is genuine and its
-- integrability near `0` really does require the harder sawtooth-average-cancellation argument
-- described there. Here, by contrast, the extra `realTrigammaSeriesNat(s/L)` factor's own
-- singularity at `s = 0` is *exactly* what cancels against the numerator, and the elementary
-- global bounds above suffice — no limiting/continuity argument at the single point `s = 0` is
-- needed at all (that point is not even in `Ioc 0 L`), only a genuine uniform bound for `s > 0`.

    genuinely Vasyunin-specific combinatorial content, per the task brief's item 2): reducing
    the joint-period (`L = lcm h k`) integral
    `∫_0^L {s/h}{s/k} · realTrigammaSeriesNat(s/L) ds` (after applying
    `tsum_inv_shifted_sq_eq_rescaled_realTrigammaSeriesNat` and
    `realTrigammaSeriesInt_reflection`/its one-sided analogue to recognize the weight in closed
    form as `π²/sin²(π s/L)` up to bookkeeping) down to the *individual* periods `h` and `k` of
    the two sawtooth factors, and from there to the explicit finite cotangent sum
    `cotangentSumVFormula h k + cotangentSumVFormula k h` (Vasyunin's original computation,
    partitioning `(0, L)` into `h·k` sub-arcs on which `{s/h}` and `{s/k}` are simultaneously
    affine in `s`, and applying classical Dedekind-sum-style cotangent reciprocity to each
    piece). This is a genuine multi-page classical argument (see the doc-comment on
    `tsum_shifted_integrals_eq_cotangent_sum` in `VasyuninBridge.lean` for the precise
    mathematical content) and is NOT attempted in this session — this statement exists only to
    record precisely what remains, in terms of the machinery now available in this file. -/
