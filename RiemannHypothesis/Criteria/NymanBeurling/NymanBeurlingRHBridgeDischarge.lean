# Nyman--Beurling forward bridge: discharged Mellin identities

The χ and generator Mellin evaluations are now theorems in
`NBChiMellin` and `H15RhoBDBaseDischarge`.  This file wires those results into
the existing RH-bridge debt package.  The remaining fields are deliberately
kept explicit: continuity of the Mellin evaluation under the L² approximation
and the zero-detection/transport step are the genuine Nyman--Beurling
analytic argument.  In particular, this file does not use the historical
iff axiom and does not claim to prove Plancherel or the zero-detection step.

/-- The residual analytic input after the χ and generator Mellin formulas have
been discharged.  `eval_functional_continuous` is the fixed-point continuity
estimate needed to pass from finite L² approximation to Mellin values;
`vanishing_transport` is the zero-detection step that turns vanishing of all
generator transforms into vanishing of the χ transform.  Both are stated as
content-bearing hypotheses, not axioms. -/

/-- The forward RH bridge conditional on exactly the residual Mellin transport
debts.  This is the project-facing endpoint for the currently available
Mellin work: the finite criterion conversion and the χ/generator formulas are
fully theorem-level, while the Plancherel/continuity and zero-detection
analysis remains isolated in `NymanBeurlingMellinTransportDebts`. -/
